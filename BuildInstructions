# This is my (Neil's) build instructions for the AOI driver. Mainly it is about knowing the cmake
# incantation, and also knowing that you need the GDAL source code available. 
#
# If anyone would care to re-write this as a more generic INSTALL.txt, feel free. 

# You will need the GDAL source code handy. Unzip it into the current directory, e.g.
#     tar xfJ gdal-2.3.0.tar.xz
#
# Know what your preferred C anc C++ compilers are called. 
# Know where to find your GDAL include and lib files, which are in the GDAL install directory.

# Copy the resulting ogr_AOI.so to the directory set aside for it,
